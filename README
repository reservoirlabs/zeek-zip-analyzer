Zeek ZIP File Analyzer
=================================

libzip 1.7.1  must be installed

This analyzer identifies ZIP signatures and extracts all files contained in an archive. The following mimetypes are supported:

- "application/zip"
- "application/epub+zip"
- "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
- "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation"
- "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"

Recursive analysis is also supported which allows analysis of nested zip files. Furthermore, it is possible to analyze decompressed files if there is a supported analyzer for its mimetype by adding a regex pattern and analyzer tag pair to ZIP::config_analyzers

In order to retrieve the right analyzer tag of a built in analyzer, take the suffix of the enums here: https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/file-analyzers.html#file-analyzers

Example of attaching PDF analyzer to all files with mimetype "application/pdf" for recursive analysis:

redef ZIP::config_analyzers += { ["application/pdf"] = "PDF", };
